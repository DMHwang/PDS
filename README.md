# PDS: Solar Flare Detection Using Machine Learning

Raymond Blaha, Paul Hwang, David Nezelek

## Project Overview

Solar flares have important implications with our solar system. We will attempt to improve upon the prexisting model that NASA has using machine learning tools and algorithms.

## Project Summary

Using the GOES dataset (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/satellite/goes-r.html), we preprocessed the data to grab time, fluxes (XRSA and XRSB), and instances of solar flares and used different time series models (LSTM, Conv1D, and mixture) and an autoencoder to detect instances of solar flares.
